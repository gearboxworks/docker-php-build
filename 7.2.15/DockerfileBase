# Here's the go. We are going to generate a PHP base package first which contains a full PHP install.
# This is then used by DockerfileRuntime OR DockerfileTarball to generate the real runtime PHP container.
# We do this to avoid having to rebuild PHP completely if we have only minor changes to be made to the PHP container.
# Saves time!
