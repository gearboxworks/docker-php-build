# Here's the go. We are going to generate a PHP base package first which contains a full PHP install.
# This is then used by DockerfileRuntime OR DockerfileTarball to generate the real runtime PHP container.
# We do this to avoid having to rebuild PHP completely if we have only minor changes to be made to the PHP container.
# Saves time!
ARG VERSION="5.5.38"


# 1. First reference the php-base image.
FROM gearboxworks/php-base:$VERSION as php-base


# 2. Generate a PHP tarball from /usr/local
RUN mkdir -p /build/output && tar zcvf /build/output/php.tar.gz /usr/local


# 3. Load Gearbox default container.
FROM gearboxworks/gearbox-base:alpine-3.7


# 4. Copy the tarball generated from the previous layer to this new layer.
COPY --from=php-base /build/output/php.tar.gz /build/output/php.tar.gz


# 5. Set up env variables.
ARG VERSION="5.5.38"
MAINTAINER Gearbox Team <team@gearbox.works>


# 6. Copy the build directory to the layer.
COPY build /build
COPY gearbox.json /build/gearbox.json


# 7. Install tarball and other depends.
RUN /bin/sh /build/build-php.sh


# 8. Expose ports.
EXPOSE 22 9000 9970


# 9. Set default command to exec.
# USER gearbox
WORKDIR /project/www
# ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/php-entrypoint"]
